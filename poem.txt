Yes, I miss you.
When I'm not looking, the softest parts of me
Will issue restraining orders.
Not the kind that define borders or boundaries;
These are the kind that will keep me in place when I ask
"Please, call me when you get there."
Because every somewhere I go to,
Is just another place that reminds me I miss you.

And my broken heart is where I keep the scar-tissue
That I use to dry my eyes when a tear tries to make a break for it.
I've built my eyelids into an Alcatraz,
Where every prisoner has a parole board meeting scheduled for yesterday. And they play dominoes until time comes full circle,
Like a sunrise, and today tries to set them free
Because they'll be locked up here until I let them go,
Until it's safe to let you know
You're my best friend.
And that some things end
So that other things can begin.
Sometimes an ending can be an origin.
That history is a resin that can keep
Two people stuck together,
That change can be a tether if you let it.

I'll always want to kiss you.
Or touch you.
Or do that thing that drives you crazy.
And by that, I mean you literally go crazy when I call you "cranky pants."
Sorry, but it makes me laugh.
And that's important to someone
Who's given more than half of their life to tragedy.
I keep your side of the bed empty with a just-in-case mentality 
That hope's middle name is maybe and maybe you miss me too.
One day,
You and I are going to make it through this.
And we'll look back
And we'll realize
That we have,
And we did.
Promise.
